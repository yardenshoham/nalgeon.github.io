SQLite is getting a lot of attention lately. That's great!

So I decided what we are missing is a weekly newsletter. And immediately started one. Every week I will publish important news, notable articles, handy extensions, tricky questions, useful code samples and other awesome SQLite-related stuff.

The first issue is already out.

I really don't like newsletter services, but I do love open source. That's why SQLite Weekly is hosted on GitHub. I see this as a win-win for everyone:

-   Easy for me to write.
-   Comfortable for others to read.
-   Enables collaboration.
-   No privacy issues.
-   Email notifications and a built-in RSS feed.

Watch the repo to get an email when the next issue is published. Maybe star it too if you like the idea:
