Just after writing that debugging multi-line queries [in SQLite shell](/sqlite-history/) is not easy, I discovered a cool trick on the sqlite forum:

Use `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+J` instead of `Enter` for new lines. After that, edit the query with the `â†‘` button.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-7">
<figure>
  <img alt="SQLite shell" src="multiline.png" class="img-bordered-thin">
</figure>
</div>
</div>

And here are some more ways to edit multi-line queries:

-   Use external editor (`.shell <editor> <file>`)
-   Run query from file (`.read <file>`)
-   Consider DBeaver, DataGrip or other UI tool
