While trying to trick AI into saying ethically questionable things may be fun for some of us, I prefer more practical and useful scenarios.

So, as of today, [Sqlime](https://sqlime.org/) — an online SQLite playground — includes the "Ask AI" feature.

AI can explain, teach, and troubleshoot your SQL without leaving the playground:

1. Write a question as a comment above the query.
2. Click "Ask AI".
3. Receive a not-so-fast, but often useful answer from AI.

Try it out! All you need is an OpenAI API key.
