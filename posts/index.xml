Previously we&amp;rsquo;ve covered ranking, offset and aggregate window functions.
​Rolling aggregates (also known as sliding or moving aggregates) are just totals — sum, average, count etc. But instead of calculating them across all elements, we take a different approach.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some examples.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Data with SQL Window Functions</title><link>https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-aggregation/</guid><description>This is an excerpt from my book SQL Window Functions Explained.

Aggregation means counting totals or averages (or other aggregates). For example, the average salary per city. Or the total number of gold medals for each country in the Olympic Games standings.
We will aggregate records from the employees table:</description></item><item><title>AI SQLite Assistant</title><link>https://antonz.org/sqlime-ai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/sqlime-ai/</guid><description>While trying to trick AI into saying ethically questionable things may be fun for some of us, I prefer more practical and useful scenarios.
So, as of today, Sqlime — an online SQLite playground — includes the &amp;ldquo;Ask AI&amp;rdquo; feature.
AI can explain, teach, and troubleshoot your SQL without leaving the playground:
Write a question as a comment above the query. Click &amp;ldquo;Ask AI&amp;rdquo;. Receive a not-so-fast, but often useful answer from AI.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Bot in Python</title><link>https://antonz.org/pokitoki/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/pokitoki/</guid><description>In the last few months, people have been releasing a record number of AI-powered software. Of course I could not stay out of it.
And so the pokitoki project was born. It&amp;rsquo;s a a Telegram chat bot built using the ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) language model from OpenAI.
Notable features:
Both one-on-one and group chats. Direct questions, mentions, follow-ups. Access external links (articles, code, data). Shortcuts (custom AI commands). Personal chats The bot acts as your personal assistant:</description></item><item><title>Interactive SQL Examples in JavaScript</title><link>https://antonz.org/interactive-sql-examples/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/interactive-sql-examples/</guid><description>Reading about SQL is fun, but trying out live examples is even better! So I created JavaScript widgets that turn static SQL code in your articles into interactive examples.
Here is a working example. Give it a try:
select * from employees limit 5; And here are the four steps to creating executable SQL examples in your own articles or documentation:
1. Include the widgets You&amp;rsquo;ll need three JavaScript files:</description></item><item><title>Reading and Writing Files in SQLite</title><link>https://antonz.org/sqlean-fileio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/sqlean-fileio/</guid><description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s useful to load a dataset from an external file or export query results to a file.
SQLite does not support file I/O operations by default. However, you can easily enable them using the sqlean-fileio extension.
Note. Unlike other DBMS, adding extensions to SQLite is a breeze. Download a file, run one database command — and you are good to go.
sqlean-fileio solves common import/export tasks such as:</description></item><item><title>Comparing by Offset with SQL Window Functions</title><link>https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-offset/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-offset/</guid><description>This is an excerpt from my book SQL Window Functions Explained.

Previously we&amp;rsquo;ve covered ranking window functions.
Comparing by offset means looking at the difference between neighboring values. For example, if you compare the countries ranked 5th and 6th in the world in terms of GDP, how different are they? What about 1st and 6th?</description></item><item><title>Building a Pivot Table in SQLite</title><link>https://antonz.org/sqlite-pivot-table/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/sqlite-pivot-table/</guid><description>Suppose we have a sales table with product incomes for the years 2020-2023:

Ranking means coming up with all kinds of ratings, from the winners of the World Swimming Championships to the Forbes 500.
We will rank records from the toy employees table:
