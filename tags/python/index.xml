def get_user_email(user_id): user = find_by_id(user_id) return user[&amp;#34;email&amp;#34;] But there is a problem. find_by_id() calls a terribly slow legacy system:
def find_by_id(user_id): # simulate a slow network request, # returning a user by their id time.sleep(1) return { &amp;#34;email&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;...&amp;#34; } 100 calls for get_user_email(42) result in 100 slow requests. A single one should be quite enough, so let&amp;rsquo;s attach a simple cache:</description></item><item><title>How Python list really works</title><link>https://antonz.org/list-internals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 17:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/list-internals/</guid><description>This post is largely about the arrays — the #1 data structure in the world. If you are not a data structure guru yet, I guarantee that you will better understand Python lists, their advantages and limitations. If you already know everything — there is no harm in refreshing the key points.
Everybody knows how to work with lists in Python:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; guests = [&amp;#34;Frank&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Claire&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Zoe&amp;#34;] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; guests[1] &amp;#39;Claire&amp;#39; Surely you know that selecting an item by index — guests[idx] — works instantly even on a million elements list.</description></item><item><title>Good Code Criterion</title><link>https://antonz.org/good-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/good-code/</guid><description>Good code is understandable and non-greedy. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it.
Time to understanding The main criterion for good code is the time T it takes for a non-author to understand the code. Not &amp;ldquo;I sorta get it&amp;rdquo;, but understand deep enough to make changes and not break anything.
The smaller the T, the better the code.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say Alice and Bob implemented the same feature, and you want to modify it.</description></item><item><title>How to make an awesome Python package in 2021</title><link>https://antonz.org/python-packaging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:30:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/python-packaging/</guid><description>If you are like me, every once in a while you write a useful python utility and want to share it with your colleagues. The best way to do this is to make a package: it easy to install and saves from copy-pasting.
If you are like me, you might be thinking that creating packages is a real headache. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not the case anymore. And I am going to prove it with this step-by-step guide.</description></item><item><title>Automate your Python project with Makefile</title><link>https://antonz.org/makefile-automation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 17:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonz.org/makefile-automation/</guid><description>When working on a library or application, certain tasks tend to show up over and over again:
checking the code with linters, running tests with coverage, deploying with Docker, &amp;hellip; JS developers are lucky (ha!): their package.json has a special scripts section for this stuff:
{ ... &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;format&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;prettier --write \&amp;quot;src/**/*.ts\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lint&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;tslint -p tsconfig.json&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;jest --coverage --config jestconfig.json&amp;quot;, }, ... } Nothing like this is provided with Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
